ExcelFormat
===========

*Original author: Martin Fuchs*  
*Integration with CMake and bii: metamaker*

ExcelFormat allows reading, writing, and editing of XLS (BIFF8 format) files using C++. For more details see <http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/42504/ExcelFormat-Library>.

For example application which uses ExcelFormat see <https://github.com/metamaker/ExcelFormat-BiiExample>. 

How to build
------------

You can use this library with `bii` (<http://www.biicode.com>). To do this follow next steps:

1. In some source file of your project include ExcelFormat by adding `#include <ExcelFormat/ExcelFormat.h>`.
2. Initialize bii block inside your project's folder (if not yet then run `$ bii init -L`).
3. Run `$ bii find` to download dependencies and create `biicode.conf` file in the root of your project.
4. Wire dependencies to `biicode.conf`:

        [requirements]
	        metamaker/ExcelFormat: 0

        [includes]
            ExcelFormat/*: metamaker/ExcelFormat/include

5. Run `$ bii cpp:configure`. You can specify your CMake generator with `-G` flag like `$ bii cpp:configure -G "Visual Studio 12"`.
6. Run `$ bii cpp:build` to build your project.

Another possible option is CMake (<http://www.cmake.org/>). The steps are next:

1. Open command line and change current directory with `$ cd` command to the directory where you unpacked the project's source code.
2. Run `$ cmake -H. -Bbuild -G "Visual Studio 12"` to create Makefile for Visual Studio 2013 (or use other generator if you use other IDE). Don't forget to specify path to dependency libraries and headers with -D parameter.
3. Open `build/ExcelFormat.sln` and build solution in Visual Studio.
4. Optionally, you can install library by building project which name is `INSTALL` in Visual Studio. Remember that you must have enough rights on your system to let VS copy files to installation folder.
