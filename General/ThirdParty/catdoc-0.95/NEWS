   0.95 May 25 2016
	Replaced charset tables with new ones, published by Unicode Consortium with
    more permissive license.
	Fixed some incompatibilities with CLang
    Fixed lot of segfaults on incorrect or corrupted data
    Use stdint int types throughout the code, add configure check for stdint.h

   0.94.2 Feb 25 2005
	Now ole Root Entry is searched by entry type rather than by
	name. It is better fix for same problem which was fixed in
	0.94.1. Fixed building of catppt postscript docs. It might be
	not qualify for release, but since I've lost archives and have
	no hope of recreating distribution with same SHA1 sum from
	working copy of repository which was left, I prefer to make new
	release.  0.94.1 Feb 09 2006 Fixed some problems with OLE
	parsing. Fixed some issues with codepage search introduced in
	the 0.94. Fixed negative record length in ppt files. 

   0.94 May 02 2005
	Added catppt utility to process powerpoint files. Now
	xls2csv proprerly recognizes Mac and other codepages which
	Microsoft refers by numbers and other world by names. Support
	ansicpg command in RTF. Also lot of small bug fixes 0.93.4 Sep

   0.93.4 Sep 30 2004. Wedding release.
	After about a year of existence of version 0.93.3 numerous
	bug reports was send to me and incorporated into CVS.  So it is
	time to release new one. Fixed lot of bugs concerning rtf
	parser and xls3csv. Added ability to define customizable page
	separator for multipage spreadsheets and command line switch to
	specify desired maximal precission of floating point numbers
	(default now is output as many digits as it is). Also fixed bug
	with reading pre-OLE word/write files and text files (Debian
	bug #255625). 

   0.93.3 Nov 15 2003
	It was planned as feature release. It has support for Excel
	Date formatting, output of blank cells and help window in
	wordview. Unfortunately, during its development important bug
	was found in ole parser code. So I have to publish this release
	real soon after previous 0.93.2 Nov 14 2003

	Improved performance of OLE parser, fixed problems with
	unicode chars 0xFF00-0xFFFF in catdoc, rewrite wordview for
	unicode-aware version of Tcl, with support of displaying text
	in language different from current locale. Reworked autoconf
	configuration. 

   0.93.1 Sep 24 2003
	Fixed numerous bugs in newer OLE and RTF code, including
	problem with incorrectly interpreting last (incomplete)
	256-byte block of text as Unicode. Restored support for pre-OLE
	Word versions, which was accidently lost in 0.93 

   0.93 July 29 2003
    Added proper handling of OLE structure (by Alex Ott). 

   0.92 June 16 2003
	Added RTF parser at last (contributed by Alex Ott). MS-DOS
	Executable for xls2csv is included. Some code clean up and
	splitting. 

   0.91.6 May 24 2003
	Added autodetect of output charset from current locale.
	Fixed handling of RK and MULRK records in xls2csv. No more
	missing numbers. Fixed long-standing bug with loosing of first
	8 symbols when recoding text file. I finally began to provide
	MS-DOS executables for 0.91.x series 

   0.91.5 January 30 2002
	I finally got to catdoc again. UTF-8 output is added. Just
	specify utf-8 as output charset. 

   0.91.4 December 30 1999
	Fixed important bug in xls2csv - improper recognition of
	numeric cells (as opposed to formula). Fixed segfault when
	catdoc is used to recode plain text files. 

   0.91.3 December 14 1999
	Mainly xls2csv fixes - xls2csv now recognizes some options
	(man page is in sync), added endianess check to configure, so
	xls2csv compilies correctly out of the box on big-endian
	machines 

   0.91.2 October 19 1999
	This is first verison which includes xls2csv program. Also,
	some long-standed bugs are fixed and newly-introduced bug when
	catdoc hangs on broken files. Although these files are not read
	properly without -b switch. New charset koi8-u is added to
	distribution. If you want to use it in the stable version, just
	download it from here and put in the catdoc library directory.

	New switch -l is added. It causes catdoc to list available
	charsets in current charset path. 

   0.91.1 October 15 1999
	As it was expected it was wrong decision to believe
	information about extended charset from word document header.
	Now we analyze encoding for each 256-byte page separately
	(becouse it is possible that first ones would be 8-bit and
	other 16-bit). When processing non-word files (i.e. plain text)
	encodings are converted and -u is taken into account, so catdoc
	can be used as generic character converter, which supports utf8
	and utf16 (both byteorders) as input.  0.91.0 October 12 1999

	Implemented new format analyzis. Now most versions of word
	format as well as MS-Write and rtf are detected. Boundaries of
	main text stream are also detected, so no more garbage is
	produced at the end of file 0.90.3 August 11 1999

	Fixed small OS-specific bugs - broken isspace in Turbo C
	Under DOS and %x was replaced %i for compatibility with SunOS 4. 

   0.90.2 May 24 1999
	Artem Chuprina pointed out to segfault error when
	non-existent charset is specified in command line. It turned
	out to be silly bug in check_charset function with oneline fix.
	You can get one-line patch. 

   0.90.1 Nov 26 1998
          Top-level Makefile now uses $MAKE instead of make
	  fixed missing end-line escaping in wordview.tcl
	  All occurences of strcpy, strcat and sprinf investigated
	  to avoid buffer overflows.
   0.90   Oct 29 1998
   	  Fixed bug with charset names redeclared locally in main()
	  Fixed problem in configure with wish 8.0.3
          Catdoc considered to be stable enough for release 
   0.90b5 Oct 14 1998
          Fixed handling of 0x1F char (soft hyphen in Word 6.0),
	  now it is translated to 0x00AD (unicode soft hyphen)
	  Fixed permissions for manual page
	  Added --with-install-root configure arg to simplify
	  building of binary packages.
   0.90b4 September 17 1998
          Added proper configuration of library dir in wordview.
	  Added --disable-charset-check config option
	  Added 0x2026 symbol in ascii.rpl
	  Added more Windows codepages in distribution
   0.90b3 September 11 1998
   	  Added -x switch to simplify debugging of substitution maps
   0.90b2 September 10 1998
          Added some symbols is 0x2000-0x20FF range to substituton maps
	  These symbols occurs in cp1251 so they are frequently found
	  in Word files. Fixed some filename-handling problems in
	  wordview.tcl

   0.90b1 September 8 1998
   	  Added us-ascii.charset, fixed small bugs in confugre,
	  install is used for all installation files. Code is
	  considered stable enough to be beta.
  
   0.90a3 September 7 1998
          Fixed small bug in table handling, which caused catdoc to
          output extra column delimiter just before row delimiter. Added
          autoconf configuration. install is back, although not for
          charsets
          
   0.90a2 August 18 1998
          version 0.90 was tested on BSDI and Solaris platform. Makefile
          was rewritten to avoid use of highly incompatible
          /usr/{ucb,bin}/install
          
   0.90a1 August 13 1998
          Catdoc undergone major rewrite. Now it has proper charset
          handling, including UNICODE and runtime configurability.
          
   0.35 - June 5 1998
          Fixed bug with -s switch which prevents catdoc from returning
          non-zero code when invoked on UNIX text file
          
   0.34 - Apr 28 1998
          Files now opened in binary mode thus allowing catdoc to work on
          DOS and simular systems. All specs arrays now have terminating
          NULL
          
   0.33 - October 1997
          Fixed missing terminating NUL in specs array, which caused
          random seqfaults on Linux and many other systems, becouse
          _specs_ is searched by _strchr_ fynction
          
   0.32 - August 1997
          First mayor public release, uploaded to CTAN. Tk interface
          appeared, manual page was written. Unfortunately, this release
          was buggy.
